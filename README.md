## Step by step:
1) Create a repository for your bootstrap landing page.
2) Deploy it into [Vercel](https://vercel.com) easily. Just login and add your repository. [Vercel](https://vercel.com) is a service for hosting static pages freely. It can also serve dynamic pages via [Next.js](https://nextjs.org) server side rendering (I'll test it later with React).
3) Register the [Servdown](https://servdown.com) for checking status/heartbeat of your service. [Servdown](https://servdown.com)  is the good option for server&service monitoring.

4) [Hipporello](https://www.hipporello.com)  connects your customers and employees to your support, IT & business teams by creating Trello cards via online forms and emails. For using [Hipporello](https://www.hipporello.com) you just need a [Trello](https://trello.com/) account create a board with [Hipporello](https://www.hipporello.com) power-up. Then you can use and customize preset forms. 

&emsp;&emsp;I've used [Hipporello](https://www.hipporello.com) for getting e-mail adresses to subscribtion list. Also used for contact forms at the end of the page. You can look easy usages in index html code. There are just two script links for generated forms by [Hipporello](https://www.hipporello.com).
